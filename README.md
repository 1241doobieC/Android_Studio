As I started to learn Java, I was not that sure where I should apply all these knowledges to.                                                            
And I looked it up on the internet. Its said, even today, there're still way more people who use Java to develope Android app.                                           
So....here are some practices/small apps i've developed! :)                                                                 

============================================================================                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                  
Here are some tipps you could use to take a look of how it works:                                                         
                                                                                                                  
1. Download the directories you're interested in as ZIP.                                                          
2. Unzip it.                                                                                                                  
3. Open you Android Studio, and create a new project.                                                                                                                  
4. Go to 【File】→【New】→【Import Module】→find the directory you just downloaded.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                  
Here are two different ways you could use to run the app:                                                                                            
/*************************************************************************                                                                                                                                                                      
5a. (Run with your Phone) Have your Android Phone connect with your computer.Then find the "Run" button and press it!                                                       
5b. (Run with a virtual device) Go to 【Tools】→【AVD Manager】→【Create virtual Device】→Choose the size → Select a API level (23-26 is recommanded for developing)                                                           
5b02. Then find the "Run" button and press it!                                                                                                                        
*************************************************************************/                                                                                             
I Personally recommand you to use the 5a instead of 5b, for some people 5b might be way more slower due to their RAM. (RAM should be AT LEAST 8G). But if your computer has more than 8G RAM, then its ok to try both ways!
